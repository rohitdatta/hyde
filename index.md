  Hey there! My name is Rohit Datta and I'm a software engineer in San Francisco.

I currently work for Apple within Platform Infrastructure Engineering working on offering Apache Kafka as a service. I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with degrees in computer science and finance ðŸ¤˜.

Before Apple, I worked on some great stuff:

* Interned at [Apple](https://apple.com): I worked on Platform Infrastructure Engineering Queueing team to build a load testing framework.
* Interned at [Clover](https://clover.com): I was a member of the server engineering team, building an event processing system in Kafka to handle thousands of transactions
